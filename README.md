# TbSync
[Thunderbird Add-On] Sync contacts, tasks and calendars to thunderbird using Exchange Active Sync (EAS). 

## How to get started

A quick start guide on how to use this Add-On can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/jobisoft/TbSync/wiki/How-to-get-started) of this repository. The latest release and the latest stable beta can be found at the [release page](https://github.com/jobisoft/TbSync/releases).

## Found a bug?

First update to the latest beta of the latest [release](https://github.com/jobisoft/TbSync/releases), activate debug logging (TbSync Account Manager -> Help), try to reproduce the error and send me the debug.log.

## Got a question? Maybe it has been answered already!

You can use the [issue section](https://github.com/jobisoft/TbSync/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for support or feature requests, but please take the extra minute to check, if your question has been asked and answered already.

As this is still work in progress, take a look at the [detailed roadmap](https://github.com/jobisoft/TbSync/wiki/Detailed-changelog-&-roadmap), to see if a feature is scheduled to be implemented. If so, it is obviously not yet implemented. Asking me how long it will take, will not get it done any faster. A [donation](https://www.paypal.me/johnbieling) might help :-)
