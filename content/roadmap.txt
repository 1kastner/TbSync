[x] reorganize js files into "gui" and "sync" - "sync" should only be loaded by messenger.js

[x] move all ProfD operations into tzcommon
[x] ask for password, if wrong or missing
[ ] move all pref queries out of tzsync
[x] make books (mapping) and devideId auto managed
[ ] store syncid in pref of book 
[ ] on delete of a book, perform all needed "reset" options - but deviceId should stay?

write global function to get and set account prefs, which takes an account parameter, which is ignored first (if no id is given, pref is global) - OR prefs need to be registered - unknown prefs get ignored ?

Can I loop preferences -> request load folder -> observer -> loadFolders -> update prefs -> lifeupdated prefs?

update gui to allow multiple accounts

update gui to load all folders

deviceId should be hidden and should be automanaged. (displayed but not editable as with iPhone) - standard format?

some error log
