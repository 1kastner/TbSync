[x] reorganize js files into "gui" and "sync" - "sync" should only be loaded by messenger.js

[x] move all ProfD operations into tzcommon
[x] ask for password, if wrong or missing
[ ] move all pref queries out of tzsync
[ ] make books (mapping) and devideId auto managed

write global function to get and set account prefs, which takes an account parameter, which is ignored first (if no id is given, pref is global) - OR prefs need to be registered - unknown prefs get ignored ?

Can I loop preferences -> request load folder -> observer -> loadFolders -> update prefs -> lifeupdated prefs?

update gui to allow multiple accounts

update gui to load all folders

deviceId should be hidden and should be automanaged. (displayed but not editable as with iPhone) - standard format?
