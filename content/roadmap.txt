instead of creating empty files in folder "deletedCards", write id of deletedCards in file "deletedCards" (to make it multi account ready) - same for all other file ops.

write global function to get and set account prefs, which takes an account parameter, which is ignored first (if no id is given, pref is global) - OR prefs need to be registered - unknown prefs get ignored ?

reorganize js files into "gui" and "sync" - "sync" should only be loaded by observer

Can I loop preferences -> request load folder -> observer -> loadFolders -> update prefs -> lifeupdated prefs?

update gui to allow multiple accounts

update gui to load all folders

deviceId should be hidden and should be automanaged. (displayed but not editable as with iPhone) - standard format?

some error log
