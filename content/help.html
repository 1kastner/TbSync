<h3>Birthdays</h3>

<p>There seems to be a problem with entering birthday data in some
versions of Zarafa Webaccess. It does work in the Webapp.<br>
This is why there is a check box "Send Birthday Information" in the account settings dialog.<br>
This is a bug in  Zarafa not in TbSync.</p>

<h3>Debug</h3>

<p>Set <b>tbsync.debugwbxml</b> to <b>true</b> in about:config to print the xml being sent and received by TbSync in the
error console. It will also dump the raw wbxml in <i>[TB profile folder]/TbSync/wbxml-debug.log</i>.<p>

<p>Switch off debug output if no longer needed and delete the log file.</p>
