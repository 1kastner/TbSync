<h4>Birthdays</h4>

<p>There seems to be a problem with entering birthday data in some
versions of Zarafa Webaccess. It does work in the Webapp.<br>
This is why there is a check box "Send Birthday Information"<br>
This is a Zarafa bug not TbSync<br>
</p>

<h4>gcontactsync</h4>

<p>gcontactsync add its own aniversary field as does TbSync.<br>
You can disable showing the anniversary field in TbSync by setting
tbsync.showanniversary to false in about:config.<br>
</p>

<h4>Extra ActiveSync Fields</h4>

<p>TbSync will add in extra fields for phone numbers in Contact main tab.<br>
To hide them set tbsync.hidephones to true in about:config.<br>
You may need this if you use other addons that alter the Contact display.<br>

</p>

<h4>Debug<br>
</h4>

<p>Set tbsync.debugwbxml to 1 in about:config<br>
</p>

This will show you the xml being sent and received by TbSync in the
error console.<br>

It will also dump the raw wbxml in profile/wbxml.<br>

Turn off after use, and delete profile/wbxml/all the stuff here<br>
