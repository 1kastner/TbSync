migrate=TbSync is evolving!\n\nTbSync started as a pure sync Add-On for ActiveSync (EAS) but has since turned into a central sync manager for multiple protocols (for example CalDAV/CardDAV).\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to move the ActiveSync provider from TbSync into a separate provider Add-On. The next version of TbSync will not include the ActiveSync provider anymore. To get this transition done without any hassle, I strongly suggest to install the separate ActiveSync provider now!\n\nDo you want to open the Add-On page of the ActiveSync provider to install it with just a few clicks?
